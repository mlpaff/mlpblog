      <description>Identifying patients at risk for opioid dependence Matthew Paff, an Insight Health Data Science fellow (Spring, 2018), recently graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a Ph.D.Â in Cell and Molecular Biology. There he modeled population dynamics of transmissible anti-viral defense using bacteriophage (viruses that infect bacteria) and developed novel approaches for genetically engineering attenuated vaccines.
This spring I participated in the Insight Health Data Science Fellowship, working as a consultant for Ovation; a provider of cloud-based LIMS and commercial platform for specialzed diagnostic labs.</description>
